## Assumptions
A member can only access tasks assigned to them.

Admin users are invited via a tokenized link(458894) and cannot self-register.

File uploads are stored on the backend’s local directory for simplicity.

The APK was generated using a React Native wrapper around the web app or WebView solution for demonstration.
